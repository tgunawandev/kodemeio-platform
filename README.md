# kodemeio-dokploy

Source of truth for Kodemeio services operated through Dokploy: deployment
manifests, environment contracts, infrastructure, monitoring, and runbooks.

The executable CLI is maintained separately in
[kodemeio-skills](https://github.com/tgunawandev/kodemeio-skills). This repository
consumes `kctl-dokploy`; it does not contain CLI implementation code.

## Tooling

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- `kctl-dokploy==0.16.6`
- Terraform 1.5+ for infrastructure validation

Install repository dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
uv tool install "kctl-dokploy==0.16.6"
```

Every Dokploy invocation must select an explicit profile:

```bash
kctl-dokploy -p <profile> doctor ai-summary
kctl-dokploy -p <profile> deploy validate \
  -f deploys/instances/production/mac-react-sfa.yaml
kctl-dokploy -p <profile> deploy apply \
  -f deploys/instances/production/mac-react-sfa.yaml --dry-run
```

Run the local quality gate:

```bash
just check
```

## Deployment flow

The declarative pipeline is:

```text
validate → preflight → DNS → database → registry → compose → environment
→ domain → deploy → verify → backup → schedules → post-deploy
```

Production execution is manual and environment-protected. Pull requests run
offline validation; deployment requires an explicit manifest, profile, and
GitHub environment.

## Safety invariants

- Never commit real `.env` files. Commit only sanitized `.env.*.example` files.
- Standard HTTP services join the external `dokploy-network` and route through
  Traefik domains.
- Do not publish HTTP service ports directly unless a documented protocol
  exception requires it.
- Never stop or remove the `dokploy` or `traefik` platform containers through
  repository automation.
- Treat deployment submission as asynchronous and wait for verification before
  reporting success.
